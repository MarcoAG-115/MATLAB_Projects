# MATLAB_Projects
A variety of MATLAB projects created when learning the language. These projects show the progression of my understanding with the coding language.
These projects show experience with sorting algorithms, matrices, and generating visual elements.
Some projects also show how my coding knowledge was applied for solving physics and engineering related problems (i.e. Inertia, Projectile, & Cantilever projects).
